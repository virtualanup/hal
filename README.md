Hal can check time for you

    > hal whats the time
    The time is 09:27 PM

Hal can check time in other cities

    > hal whats the time in london
    The time is 02:28 in London, Europe

Hal can tell you a joke

    > hal tell me a joke
    I find it ironic that the colors red, white, and blue stand for freedom until they are flashing behind you.

Hal can do unit conversions for you

    > hal convert 5 celsius to fahrenheit
    Result : 9.0 degF

But Unfortunately, there are some things Hal can't do

    > hal please open the pod bay door
    I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

Hal is influenced by [Betty](https://github.com/pickhardt/betty).
